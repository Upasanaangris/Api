Build and host a REST API (Method: POST) that takes in an array and returns the following:
1. Status
2. User ID
3. Email ID
4. College Roll Number
5. Array for even numbers
6. Array for odd numbers
7. Array for alphabets, converted to uppercase
Please refer to Annexure (A) for request/response samples
Preferred Tech Stack
Node.js / Python / Java
Hosting
Any provider of your choice, if you don’t have one already, please use Heroku / Netlify / Vercel/ any other
provider which supports REST API hosting.
Logic
1. Response should always contain your user_id (fullname_dob) in the following format
a. "user_id": {full_name_ddmmyyyy}
E.g.: "user_id”: "john_doe_17091999"

2. “is_success” should be returned in the response to mark the status of operation. It can be true / false
3. Be sure to follow other best practices and handle exceptions gracefully
4. Method: POST
5. Route: /bfhl
a. Example: https://testbfhl.herokuapp.com/bfhl
Submission
1. Develop the API in any of the languages mentioned in (II)
2. Host your API (refer to III)
3. Share the API endpoint in the form given to you
Form Link: https://forms.office.com/r/91Y30mFyys
4. Fastest valid submissions will be considered
5. The URL that you submit should have the logic specified above in “/bfhl” route
